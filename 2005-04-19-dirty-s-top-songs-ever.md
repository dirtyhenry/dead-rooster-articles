With some friends of ours, we made up a very cool game: "pick the songs that
would make the best 80 minutes of music ever".

The rules are simple:

- don’t pick more than one song for a single artist;
- try not to pick the best song of each of your favorite bands, just pick the
  best songs ever! (who cares of the band has made only one good song!!!).

Here is the first draft of my list: (that can evolve, of course)
